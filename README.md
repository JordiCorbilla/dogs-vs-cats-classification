# Dogs vs. Cats Image Classification Using Convolutional Neural Networks

## Overview

This project involves building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images of dogs and cats. The model is trained on a dataset of labeled images and aims to distinguish between the two classes with high accuracy.

## Dataset

- **Source:** [Kaggle's Dogs vs. Cats Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats/data)
- **Description:** The dataset contains 25,000 images of dogs and cats (12,500 images for each class).

## Project Structure

- **dogs_vs_cats.ipynb:** Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data preprocessing, model building, training, and evaluation.
- **data:** Directory containing the dataset organized into `train` and `validation` sets.
- **models:** Directory to save the trained model weights.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or higher
- Virtual environment tool (optional but recommended)

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jordicorbilla/dogs-vs-cats-classification.git
   cd dogs-vs-cats-classification
